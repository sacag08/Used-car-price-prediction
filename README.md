# Used Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the prices of used cars based on various attributes such as mileage, age, make, model, fuel type, and other relevant factors. By analyzing these attributes, the model provides price estimates that can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that determines the fair market price of a used car given its specific attributes. This model can be particularly valuable for marketplaces, dealerships, and individual buyers or sellers who want insights into a car's valuation.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key relationships and patterns in the dataset. Performed data cleaning, handling of missing values, and feature engineering to optimize model performance.
  
- **Model Selection and Training**: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble models, to identify the best-performing model. Used techniques like cross-validation to evaluate and validate models.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied Optuna for efficient hyperparameter tuning, aiming to improve model accuracy and minimize error metrics.

- **Prediction Pipeline**: Built a modular pipeline for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and prediction. This pipeline streamlines the end-to-end workflow, making it easy to update or deploy.

- **Deployment**: The final model is deployed via a Streamlit web application, enabling users to input car attributes and receive an instant price prediction.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language for model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn**: For model building and evaluation.
- **Optuna**: Used for hyperparameter optimization.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web interface for the prediction model.
  
## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and install the required libraries. You can then run the Streamlit application to test predictions with custom inputs.

## Future Enhancements
- **Feature Expansion**: Adding more attributes such as region, previous owner history, and accident records to improve model accuracy.
- **Deployment on Cloud**: Migrating the model to a cloud platform for better scalability.
  
This project highlights key skills in data preprocessing, model training, pipeline development, and deployment, demonstrating a strong foundation in building practical machine learning applications.
